Happy Birthday pop! My pop had a huge impact on me and StatQuest and I want everyone to know how StatQuest would not be the same without him. From the first statistics class I took that was terrible, but then he taught me about linear models to how he trained me not to guess and to always look for a better way.

From there it turned into \"I miss Carolina, when am I gonna head back home\" - a song about a North Carolina exile that wants to come home. So, that was inspiration #1.\n\n#2 Once I had this idea of \"I miss Carolina\", I started to think about all the political rabble rousing that's going on in the state - and this was before the Silent Sam thing happened (a bunch of people knocked over Silent Sam a few weeks ago) - they've got these crazy state constitutional amendments that are coming out of no where that we are supposed to vote on. One of them declares that \"hunting and fishing will be the primary means for managing fish and wildlife populations\". Stupid stuff that seems like old folk trying to make it harder to young folk to get anything done in the state. So then the song went back to \"Miss Carolina\" - she being the true spirit of the state - she's gone and left us all covered in pretty weeds, but still weeds.\n\nNOTE: I specifically used the antiquated term \"Miss\" instead of the more modern \"Ms\" because \"Miss\" is still used for beauty pageants - when the state picks the woman who most embodies the \"spirit\" of the state - she's beautiful, but also smart, caring and determined to change the world for the better.
