It wasn't easy but I think I made the most of it. Hopefully you can learn from the mistakes I made when you start your first project or any subsequent one! \n\nMy first open ended data science project was given to me during grad school. I had to find a dataset, build a model, and predict an outcome. I thought this was going to be easy... but boy was I wrong. \n\nThe first challenge that I ran into is that I couldn't decide on a topic. I kept finding datasets, jumping into analysis and then getting stuck. I learned that I need to start with defining a problem before jumping right into the data.\n\nAfter I finally settled on a problem, my results were really disappointing.

It wasn't easy but I think I made the most of it. Hopefully you can learn from the mistakes I made when you start your first project or any subsequent one! \n\nMy first open ended data science project was given to me during grad school. I had to find a dataset, build a model, and predict an outcome. I thought this was going to be easy... but boy was I wrong. \n\nThe first challenge that I ran into is that I couldn't decide on a topic. I kept finding datasets, jumping into analysis and then getting stuck. I learned that I need to start with defining a problem before jumping right into the data.\n\nAfter I finally settled on a problem, my results were really disappointing. I was too focused on optimizing my models than analyzing WHY I was getting these bad results. \n\nFinally, I got through the \"hard stuff\" and threw together a presentation. I ended up getting all of my points deducted because my presentation stunk.

(Affiliate Links)\nMy Course:  https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-start-a-career-in-data-science/?couponCode=B494DE89644576BEBD46\n@TinaHuang1's Course: https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OXAy7KE1wsg&mid=39197&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fsql-for-tech-and-data-science-interviews%2F\n365 DS course: https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=OXAy7KE1wsg&mid=39197&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fthe-data-science-course-complete-data-science-bootcamp%2F\nOfficial Udemy Page for the #66DaysOfData: https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=OXAy7KE1wsg&offerid=624447.17226&type=3&subid=0\n\n\nLesson 1 - Don't evaluate your performance against others. Often we compare results even though the inputs are wildly different. You may think you're bad at something even though the people you are comparing yourself have practiced 5x more. Everyone starts as a beginner on this journey. \n\nLesson 2 - Develop a growth mindset. One of the most important steps of learning to learn is realizing you are capable of growth. Proving to yourself that you can get better over time is immeasurably powerful. \n\nLesson 3 - Find your motivation through purpose (or something close to it). Purpose can be hard to find, it takes tremendous introspection to cultivate this calling. Still, once you find yourself there, you will have all the motivation you need to reach your goals.\n \nLesson 4 - Change your identity. In order to make true change, you have to become the change you want to embody. Talk to yourself like you're someone who is capable and you will become capable. \n\nLesson 5 - Find Flow. There are certain criteria that can be met to achieve deep focus. Understand how you focus and unleash your new found superpower onto the world. \n\nLesson 6 - Develop the learning skillset. Reading, organizing information, etc. are needed to learn at a high level. Understand the science of learning to unlock this potential.\n\nLesson 7 - Develop consistency through habits. We can take off the burden if we have good habits. Habits give structure to our lives and allow us to organize information. They also can make difficult tasks seemingly effortless. \n\nLesson 8 - Do Projects.\n\n0:00 Intro \n0:53 Lesson 1\n2:18 Lesson 2\n3:56 Lesson 3\n6:22 Lesson 4\n8:05 Lesson 5\n10:30 Lesson 6\n12:48 Lesson 7\n12:14 Lesson 8\n\n\n\n#KenJee #MetaLearning \n\n⭕ Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/kenjee1?sub_confirmation=1\n🎙 Listen to My Podcast: https://www.youtube.com/c/KensNearestNeighborsPodcast\n🕸 Check out My Website - https://kennethjee.com/\n✍️Sign up for My Newsletter - https://www.kennethjee.com/newsletter\n📚 Books and Products I use -  https://www.amazon.com/shop/kenjee (affiliate link)\n\nPartners & Affiliates \n🌟 365 Data Science - Courses ( 57% Annual Discount): https://365datascience.pxf.io/P0jbBY\n🌟 Interview Query - https://www.interviewquery.com/?ref=kenjee\n\nMORE DATA SCIENCE CONTENT HERE:\n🐤My Twitter - https://twitter.com/KenJee_DS\n👔 LinkedIn -  https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenjee/\n📈 Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/kenjee\n📑 Medium Articles - https://medium.com/@kenneth.b.jee\n💻 Github - https://github.com/PlayingNumbers\n🏀 My Sports Blog -https://www.playingnumbers.com\n\nCheck These Videos Out Next! \nMy Leaderboard Project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myhoWUrSP7o&ab_channel=KenJee\n66 Days of Data: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV_AlRwhI3I&ab_channel=KenJee\nHow I Would Learn Data Science in 2021: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Clrh6nv1s&ab_channel=KenJee\n\nMy Playlists \nData Science Beginners: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5ATMsmyRazei7ZXkP1GHt-vs\nProject From Scratch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpF9HENQjDo&list=PL2zq7klxX5ASFejJj80ob9ZAnBHdz5O1t&ab_channel=KenJee\nKaggle Projects: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5AQXzNSLtc_LEKFPh2mAvHIO", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S4Lei5mOppc/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S4Lei5mOppc/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S4Lei5mOppc/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S4Lei5mOppc/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/S4Lei5mOppc/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Ken Jee", "tags": ["Data Science", "Ken Jee", "Machine Learning", "Sports Analytics", "data scientist", "data science journey", "data science 2021", "Meta learning", "how I learned to learn", "learning to learn", "learning skill", "learning journey", "flow", "self help", "personal improvement", "ultralearning", "growth mindset", "learning mistakes", "Learn new things fast", "become a better student", "personal growth", "movtivation"], "categoryId": "22", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "How I Learned to Learn.", "description": "In this video I take you through my meta-learning journey.

More broadly, I find that these feelings come in a couple different varieties. (Confusion, anxiety, stress, and frustration), overwhelm/ Hopelessness, and inadequacy. \n\nThe first group of feelings are usually temporary. The arise when we are struggling with a specific problem. I find that these manifest themselves in physical symptoms for myself. I get headaches, I get antsy, I feel tired. To combat these, I have found that a physical change is the most effective remedy. \n\nFor overwhelm and hopelessness in data science, these feelings don't go away easily. Usually you feel helpless after you get overwhelmed by how big the field is. First, no one is expected to have an understanding over the complete domain of data science. There are a couple things you can do here. First, focus on projects. These are a great way to narrow the scope of learning. Second, build or subscribe to a structured course of study. 365 Data Science (the sponsor of this video), provides a great curriculum for this.\n\nFinally, the feeling of inadequacy is the largest contributor to discouragement (Impostor Syndrome). I first recommend starting to cultivate a growth mindset. Second, track your progress, remind yourself how far you've come.

Second, build or subscribe to a structured course of study. 365 Data Science (the sponsor of this video), provides a great curriculum for this.\n\nFinally, the feeling of inadequacy is the largest contributor to discouragement (Impostor Syndrome). I first recommend starting to cultivate a growth mindset. Second, track your progress, remind yourself how far you've come. Finally, use real data to evaluate yourself. \n\n0:00 Intro\n1:00 Find out Why\n1:32 Anxiety, Confusion, & Frustration\n3:25 Overwhelm & Hopelessness\n6:20 Inadequacy (Impostor Syndrome)\n9:05 Stop Discouragement Before It Starts!\n#DataScience #KenJee \n\n⭕ Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/kenjee1?sub_confirmation=1\n🎙 Listen to My Podcast: https://www.youtube.com/c/KensNearestNeighborsPodcast\n🕸 Check out My Website - https://kennethjee.com/\n✍️Sign up for My Newsletter - https://www.kennethjee.com/newsletter\n📚 Books and Products I use -  https://www.amazon.com/shop/kenjee (affiliate link)\n\nPartners & Affiliates \n🌟 365 Data Science - Courses ( 57% Annual Discount): https://365datascience.pxf.io/P0jbBY\n🌟 Interview Query - https://www.interviewquery.com/?ref=kenjee\n\nMORE DATA SCIENCE CONTENT HERE:\n🐤My Twitter - https://twitter.com/KenJee_DS\n👔 LinkedIn -  https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenjee/\n📈 Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/kenjee\n📑 Medium Articles - https://medium.com/@kenneth.b.jee\n💻 Github - https://github.com/PlayingNumbers\n🏀 My Sports Blog -https://www.playingnumbers.com\n\nCheck These Videos Out Next! \nMy Leaderboard Project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myhoWUrSP7o&ab_channel=KenJee\n66 Days of Data: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV_AlRwhI3I&ab_channel=KenJee\nHow I Would Learn Data Science in 2021: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Clrh6nv1s&ab_channel=KenJee\n\nMy Playlists \nData Science Beginners: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5ATMsmyRazei7ZXkP1GHt-vs\nProject From Scratch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpF9HENQjDo&list=PL2zq7klxX5ASFejJj80ob9ZAnBHdz5O1t&ab_channel=KenJee\nKaggle Projects: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5AQXzNSLtc_LEKFPh2mAvHIO"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en-US"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "7644", "likeCount": "388", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "195"}}

You gain valuable, real world, experience by doing these. You also showcase some skills that are difficult to manifest through your more traditional work.

I think it is better to start of learning one well than dividing your time. When you do this you learn about \"how programming languages work\" and you don't get as confused with pure syntax.\n\n2) Dive into challenging topics - I avoided a few hard classes till the end of my degree. It turns out I would have greatly benefited from taking them earlier on\n\n3) Consider all options when learning. You don't necessarily need an expensive masters degree to break into the field. I racked up a ton of student debt, and don't recommend it! 365 data science is a great option, also this is a link to my favorite free resources: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip50cXvpWY4&ab_channel=KenJee\n\n4) Internships & Research - I really focused hard on my grades. In the long run they didn't matter as much as my data science internships and potential research opportunities. \n\n5) Clubs & Groups - I wish I had made friends with people that had similar interests as me.

It turns out I would have greatly benefited from taking them earlier on\n\n3) Consider all options when learning. You don't necessarily need an expensive masters degree to break into the field. I racked up a ton of student debt, and don't recommend it! 365 data science is a great option, also this is a link to my favorite free resources: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip50cXvpWY4&ab_channel=KenJee\n\n4) Internships & Research - I really focused hard on my grades. In the long run they didn't matter as much as my data science internships and potential research opportunities. \n\n5) Clubs & Groups - I wish I had made friends with people that had similar interests as me. You can do this on the #66DaysOfData discord server: https://discord.gg/BRv6YGb\n\n6) ??????\n\n7) Projects. \n\n#DataScience #KenJee \n\n0:00 Intro\n0:44 Programming Language\n2:04 Avoiding the Challenge\n2:55 Student Debt\n4:16 Internships & Research\n5:00 Social Data Groups\n5:40 ?????\n5:55 Projects.\n6:44 I did stuff well too...\n7:38 How I ACTUALLY Feel About Regrets\n\n⭕ Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/kenjee1?sub_confirmation=1\n🎙 Listen to My Podcast: https://www.youtube.com/c/KensNearestNeighborsPodcast\n🕸 Check out My Website - https://kennethjee.com/\n✍️Sign up for My Newsletter - https://www.kennethjee.com/newsletter\n📚 Books and Products I use -  https://www.amazon.com/shop/kenjee (affiliate link)\n\nPartners & Affiliates \n🌟 365 Data Science - Courses ( 57% Annual Discount): https://365datascience.pxf.io/P0jbBY\n🌟 Interview Query - https://www.interviewquery.com/?ref=kenjee\n\nMORE DATA SCIENCE CONTENT HERE:\n🐤My Twitter - https://twitter.com/KenJee_DS\n👔 LinkedIn -  https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenjee/\n📈 Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/kenjee\n📑 Medium Articles - https://medium.com/@kenneth.b.jee\n💻 Github - https://github.com/PlayingNumbers\n🏀 My Sports Blog -https://www.playingnumbers.com\n\nCheck These Videos Out Next! \nMy Leaderboard Project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myhoWUrSP7o&ab_channel=KenJee\n66 Days of Data: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV_AlRwhI3I&ab_channel=KenJee\nHow I Would Learn Data Science in 2021: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Clrh6nv1s&ab_channel=KenJee\n\nMy Playlists \nData Science Beginners: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5ATMsmyRazei7ZXkP1GHt-vs\nProject From Scratch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpF9HENQjDo&list=PL2zq7klxX5ASFejJj80ob9ZAnBHdz5O1t&ab_channel=KenJee\nKaggle Projects: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5AQXzNSLtc_LEKFPh2mAvHIO"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en-US"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "24415", "likeCount": "878", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "112"}}

It was almost impossible for me to make videos, keep up with my data science learning, and do a solid job with my work. Over the last two years I started to crack the code to balancing YouTube, my work, and my leisure time. These are the ultra super secret techniques that I use to stay on top of things. \n\n1) Balance - I personally think that life balance is a myth. Let me clarify. I think balance on a day to day basis is unrealistic. Being able to fit work, leisure, health, family, spirituality, and whatever else matters to you into every single day would really stress me out. On the other hand, over the course of months or years I am certain you can find balance across multiple areas of your life. I find that focusing on long term balance (particularly weekly or monthly), is something that has allowed me to manage my time effectively. \n\n2) Elimination - A lot of people know this as 80/20 or the pareto principle. At the beginning of 2019, I read “The One Thing” and I could probably attribute about 90% of my youtube success to this book. Essentially, it says that if you focus your time almost exclusively on the single most important thing, the thing that gives you the greatest return for the least amount of time invested, you will find success.\n\n3) Hyper Prioritization - The next thing that helps me to stay “balanced” is what I call schedule hyper-prioritization. Every month I plan out exactly what I need to do for the next few weeks. Every week I plan out what I need to do every day, and every day I plan out what I should be working on each hour. This may seem like a lot of time spent planning, but as strange as this seems, it actually saves me a tremendous amount of time. \n\n4) Economies of Scope - Another part of planning is seeing what parts of your life overlap. Often times I will make a YouTube video about a topic that I needed to learn anyway for work. When I do this I am getting what are called economies of scope. This basically means that the cost (time) of producing two things together are less than producing each thing separately. \n\n5) Ask for Help - When other a tool or other people can do a portion of your work better at a lower cost than your time, it is worth outsourcing. Honestly, this is something I’ve really struggled with, I like to have control over the process, and it takes time to find systems and people that you trust to work with you. Still, I think this is so worth it. \n\n6) Make it Leisure - When you ask for help and you start to do more of the work that is fun for you and less of the work that isn’t you might start to find additional enjoyment. Something that has really helped me to do more has been finding ways to make my tasks seem more like leisure. This can be difficult to do, but can be one of the secrets to the balancing act. \n\n7) Design Your Life - Something that you can do to make your work feel like leisure over the long term is to begin to design your life. You choose roles that allow you the types of freedoms you want, you pick hobbies or side hustles that you find fun and interesting, you chase the things you want to do the most.\n\n#DataScience #KenJee\n\n⭕ Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/kenjee1?sub_confirmation=1\n🎙 Listen to My Podcast: https://www.youtube.com/c/KensNearestNeighborsPodcast\n🕸 Check out My Website - https://kennethjee.com/\n✍️Sign up for My Newsletter - https://www.kennethjee.com/newsletter\n📚 Books and Products I use -  https://www.amazon.com/shop/kenjee (affiliate link)\n\nPartners & Affiliates \n🌟 365 Data Science - Courses ( 57% Annual Discount): https://365datascience.pxf.io/P0jbBY\n🌟 Interview Query - https://www.interviewquery.com/?ref=kenjee\n\nMORE DATA SCIENCE CONTENT HERE:\n🐤My Twitter - https://twitter.com/KenJee_DS\n👔 LinkedIn -  https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenjee/\n📈 Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/kenjee\n📑 Medium Articles - https://medium.com/@kenneth.b.jee\n💻 Github - https://github.com/PlayingNumbers\n🏀 My Sports Blog -https://www.playingnumbers.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uic34RTaI-w/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uic34RTaI-w/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uic34RTaI-w/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uic34RTaI-w/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uic34RTaI-w/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Ken Jee", "tags": ["Data Science", "Ken Jee", "Machine Learning", "vlog", "data scientist", "data science journey", "data science 2020", "work life balance", "time management", "data science balance", "prioritization", "self help", "productivity", "data science productivity", "data science habits", "pareto principle", "80/20", "balance myth", "planning", "data science organization", "life design", "happiness", "66daysofdata"], "categoryId": "22", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "How I Balance Data Science and Content Creation (7 Secrets)", "description": "This is the most important video I've made if you struggle with time management.

To me, identifying problems and digging into them is one of the most important parts of becoming a data scientist to begin with. Finding interesting projects is a skill and is something you can improve on. \n\nTechnique 1 - Focus on the problems that you face. Data science can be used to help solve these and make your life or the lives of people around you easier. I recommend writing 10 project ideas each day to get you used to coming up with them.\n\nTechnique 2 - Browse datasets and find one you like.

To me, identifying problems and digging into them is one of the most important parts of becoming a data scientist to begin with. Finding interesting projects is a skill and is something you can improve on. \n\nTechnique 1 - Focus on the problems that you face. Data science can be used to help solve these and make your life or the lives of people around you easier. I recommend writing 10 project ideas each day to get you used to coming up with them.\n\nTechnique 2 - Browse datasets and find one you like. There are tons of repositories of free data online, kaggle, google datasets, etc..

Honestly, I’ve only done one technical masters degree myself, so I don’t think I can get really granular with the specific school choices.

Since I can only speak from my experience, I figure it could help a lot of people if I walked through some of the considerations I made when pursuing my own masters degree.

{"kind": "youtube#video", "etag": "q4n5geM0vpm7LixcZWyxBYFRj_Y", "id": "UpaEjBOMNqs", "snippet": {"publishedAt": "2020-10-02T15:00:08Z", "channelId": "UCiT9RITQ9PW6BhXK0y2jaeg", "title": "5 Proven Strategies to Break into a Data Science Job", "description": "In this video I talk about the 5 main strategies that are proven to land you a data science job. There may be a bonus 6th strategy at the end 😉.\n\n1) Resume drop - I believe this to be the least effective of the 5 approaches. From the data collected at sharpest minds, a data science mentoring company, they found that only 1-2 percent of resume drops actually ended up leading to an interview. This is an extremely low percentage, and this means the average person needs to apply to 50-100 jobs to get just one interview. I personally don’t like these odds. \n\n2) Private job board - An example of this would be using the job platform available from your university as a student or an alum. In most cases, this reduces the amount of applications for each role you apply to. You are no longer competing with the general public, and are now just competing with others from your university. There are also professional organizations or communities that you can be a part of that have private job boards. I would get creative with the job boards you explore and look for startup incubators, vc firms, etc. \n\n3) Recruiter - You can reach out to data science specific recruiters, but often they will reach out to you if you have a been doing projects and sharing your work. Working with a recruiter increases your odds because they have existing relationships with companies and them vouching for you gives you additional social proof. Recruiters also do a lot of the work for you, they find opportunities on your behalf and can sometimes even help you with your resume / application process. \n\n4) In-company transfer - Most companies are interested in the happiness of their employees and also saving money. If you move into a data science role within the current organization, they keep you happy, and they also get to avoid the hiring costs associated with finding a new data scientist. Most people are afraid to ask their boss about exploring new tools and trying to pivot positions. You truly never know what is possible if you don’t ask, they may even be willing to pay for your trainings. This step really only works if you’re in a role that is related to data science already, this technique makes sense if you’re in a data analyst, software engineering role, or doing something relatively technical. If you’re not doing anything close to technical, you can first try to pivot into a data analyst role and then keep transitioning slowly. \n\n5) Referral -Again, the team at sharpestminds have see that using this approach can increases your chances of getting an interview by upwards of 10 times. Having an employee refer you give you instant credibility. Additionally, hr will usually not want to disappoint the existing employee, so they will usually give you the benefit of the doubt.

There may be a bonus 6th strategy at the end 😉.\n\n1) Resume drop - I believe this to be the least effective of the 5 approaches. From the data collected at sharpest minds, a data science mentoring company, they found that only 1-2 percent of resume drops actually ended up leading to an interview. This is an extremely low percentage, and this means the average person needs to apply to 50-100 jobs to get just one interview. I personally don’t like these odds. \n\n2) Private job board - An example of this would be using the job platform available from your university as a student or an alum. In most cases, this reduces the amount of applications for each role you apply to. You are no longer competing with the general public, and are now just competing with others from your university. There are also professional organizations or communities that you can be a part of that have private job boards. I would get creative with the job boards you explore and look for startup incubators, vc firms, etc. \n\n3) Recruiter - You can reach out to data science specific recruiters, but often they will reach out to you if you have a been doing projects and sharing your work. Working with a recruiter increases your odds because they have existing relationships with companies and them vouching for you gives you additional social proof. Recruiters also do a lot of the work for you, they find opportunities on your behalf and can sometimes even help you with your resume / application process. \n\n4) In-company transfer - Most companies are interested in the happiness of their employees and also saving money. If you move into a data science role within the current organization, they keep you happy, and they also get to avoid the hiring costs associated with finding a new data scientist. Most people are afraid to ask their boss about exploring new tools and trying to pivot positions. You truly never know what is possible if you don’t ask, they may even be willing to pay for your trainings. This step really only works if you’re in a role that is related to data science already, this technique makes sense if you’re in a data analyst, software engineering role, or doing something relatively technical. If you’re not doing anything close to technical, you can first try to pivot into a data analyst role and then keep transitioning slowly. \n\n5) Referral -Again, the team at sharpestminds have see that using this approach can increases your chances of getting an interview by upwards of 10 times. Having an employee refer you give you instant credibility. Additionally, hr will usually not want to disappoint the existing employee, so they will usually give you the benefit of the doubt. If it wasn’t clear already, having a relationship with the company either through a recruiter, a friend, or a job, is what maximizes your chances. \n\n(Bonus) Internship - Internships are lower hanging fruits than traditional jobs. Often they are used to see if people would be a good fit for a full time position. I kind of look like an internship as a really long interview with a fairly high chance of success. Do your best in these and you can greatly increase your chances of landing your first full time data science job. \n\n0:00 Intro\n0:35 Approach 1 (Resume Drop)\n1:06 Approach 2 (Private Job Board)\n1:41 Approach 3 (Recruiter)\n2:10 Approach 4 (My Favorite)\n3:38 Approach 5 (The best!)\n4:12 Bonus Approach! \n\n#DataScience #KenJee \n⭕ Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/kenjee1?sub_confirmation=1\n🎙 Listen to My Podcast: https://www.youtube.com/c/KensNearestNeighborsPodcast\n🕸 Check out My Website - https://kennethjee.com/\n✍️Sign up for My Newsletter - https://www.kennethjee.com/newsletter\n📚 Books and Products I use -  https://www.amazon.com/shop/kenjee (affiliate link)\n\nPartners & Affiliates \n🌟 365 Data Science - Courses ( 57% Annual Discount): https://365datascience.pxf.io/P0jbBY\n🌟 Interview Query - https://www.interviewquery.com/?ref=kenjee\n\nMORE DATA SCIENCE CONTENT HERE:\n🐤My Twitter - https://twitter.com/KenJee_DS\n👔 LinkedIn -  https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenjee/\n📈 Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/kenjee\n📑 Medium Articles - https://medium.com/@kenneth.b.jee\n💻 Github - https://github.com/PlayingNumbers\n🏀 My Sports Blog -https://www.playingnumbers.com\n\nCheck These Videos Out Next! \nMy Leaderboard Project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myhoWUrSP7o&ab_channel=KenJee\n66 Days of Data: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV_AlRwhI3I&ab_channel=KenJee\nHow I Would Learn Data Science in 2021: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Clrh6nv1s&ab_channel=KenJee\n\nMy Playlists \nData Science Beginners: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5ATMsmyRazei7ZXkP1GHt-vs\nProject From Scratch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpF9HENQjDo&list=PL2zq7klxX5ASFejJj80ob9ZAnBHdz5O1t&ab_channel=KenJee\nKaggle Projects: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5AQXzNSLtc_LEKFPh2mAvHIO"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en-US"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "8759", "likeCount": "361", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "93"}}

It wouldn’t have been possible without them. \n\n#DataScience #KenJee \n\n⭕ Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/kenjee1?sub_confirmation=1\n🎙 Listen to My Podcast: https://www.youtube.com/c/KensNearestNeighborsPodcast\n🕸 Check out My Website - https://kennethjee.com/\n✍️Sign up for My Newsletter - https://www.kennethjee.com/newsletter\n📚 Books and Products I use -  https://www.amazon.com/shop/kenjee (affiliate link)\n\nPartners & Affiliates \n🌟 365 Data Science - Courses ( 57% Annual Discount): https://365datascience.pxf.io/P0jbBY\n🌟 Interview Query - https://www.interviewquery.com/?ref=kenjee\n\nMORE DATA SCIENCE CONTENT HERE:\n🐤My Twitter - https://twitter.com/KenJee_DS\n👔 LinkedIn -  https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenjee/\n📈 Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/kenjee\n📑 Medium Articles - https://medium.com/@kenneth.b.jee\n💻 Github - https://github.com/PlayingNumbers\n🏀 My Sports Blog -https://www.playingnumbers.com\n\nCheck These Videos Out Next! \nMy Leaderboard Project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myhoWUrSP7o&ab_channel=KenJee\n66 Days of Data: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV_AlRwhI3I&ab_channel=KenJee\nHow I Would Learn Data Science in 2021: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Clrh6nv1s&ab_channel=KenJee\n\nMy Playlists \nData Science Beginners: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5ATMsmyRazei7ZXkP1GHt-vs\nProject From Scratch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpF9HENQjDo&list=PL2zq7klxX5ASFejJj80ob9ZAnBHdz5O1t&ab_channel=KenJee\nKaggle Projects: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5AQXzNSLtc_LEKFPh2mAvHIO"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en-US"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "7390", "likeCount": "354", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "144"}}

I talk about the hardware components of a computer and how those relate to your data science performance. At the end, I give my thoughts on the best computer for you to purchase. \n\nThe cpu is in charge of the processing power of the computer. It mostly controls how fast processing for normal data science operations is. \n\nThe ram stands for random access memory. It determines how much data can be processed in a single batch.\n\nYou will also need a hard drive. I recommend stead state memory. This doesn't have much impact on performance of your models, so you don't need to go crazy here. This is the cheapest type of memory though so you can scale up at a low cost. \n\nThe last main component that is relevant for data science is the GPU. NVIDIA recently sent me a Titan RTX, and I am excited to be experimenting with that in future videos. For deep learning, you should really have at least 6 gb of gpu memory.

I talk about the hardware components of a computer and how those relate to your data science performance. At the end, I give my thoughts on the best computer for you to purchase. \n\nThe cpu is in charge of the processing power of the computer. It mostly controls how fast processing for normal data science operations is. \n\nThe ram stands for random access memory. It determines how much data can be processed in a single batch.\n\nYou will also need a hard drive. I recommend stead state memory. This doesn't have much impact on performance of your models, so you don't need to go crazy here. This is the cheapest type of memory though so you can scale up at a low cost. \n\nThe last main component that is relevant for data science is the GPU. NVIDIA recently sent me a Titan RTX, and I am excited to be experimenting with that in future videos. For deep learning, you should really have at least 6 gb of gpu memory. If you are playing graphics intensive games or editing videos, I recommend increasing this further. \n\nMy final recommendation: Your computer really doesn't matter much.

This is one of the most frequent questions that I get. Hopefully this will shed some light on your path and give you a concrete starting point.\n\nUnfortunately, everyone learns data science a little differently. What works for me may not work for you.\n\nIt matters less where you start learning and more when. You should start right now and choose a course, certificate or project. Just do it.

It shows that you understand how other people could use your model, and you have made it into a product for them. \n\nI recommend turning a model into an API endpoint or a small web page at least once for your portfolio. \n\nStay tuned for part 7 of this series where I make a github readme for this project. \n\nProject from scratch playlist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpF9HENQjDo&list=PL2zq7klxX5ASFejJj80ob9ZAnBHdz5O1t\nMy other project playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5AReJn7nZfqOKLZ3IpKj7fwc\n\n#DataScience #KenJee #DataScienceProject\n\n⭕ Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/kenjee1?sub_confirmation=1\n🎙 Listen to My Podcast: https://www.youtube.com/c/KensNearestNeighborsPodcast\n🕸 Check out My Website - https://kennethjee.com/\n✍️Sign up for My Newsletter - https://www.kennethjee.com/newsletter\n📚 Books and Products I use -  https://www.amazon.com/shop/kenjee (affiliate link)\n\nPartners & Affiliates \n🌟 365 Data Science - Courses ( 57% Annual Discount): https://365datascience.pxf.io/P0jbBY\n🌟 Interview Query - https://www.interviewquery.com/?ref=kenjee\n\nMORE DATA SCIENCE CONTENT HERE:\n🐤My Twitter - https://twitter.com/KenJee_DS\n👔 LinkedIn -  https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenjee/\n📈 Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/kenjee\n📑 Medium Articles - https://medium.com/@kenneth.b.jee\n💻 Github - https://github.com/PlayingNumbers\n🏀 My Sports Blog -https://www.playingnumbers.com\n\nCheck These Videos Out Next! \nMy Leaderboard Project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myhoWUrSP7o&ab_channel=KenJee\n66 Days of Data: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV_AlRwhI3I&ab_channel=KenJee\nHow I Would Learn Data Science in 2021: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Clrh6nv1s&ab_channel=KenJee\n\nMy Playlists \nData Science Beginners: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5ATMsmyRazei7ZXkP1GHt-vs\nProject From Scratch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpF9HENQjDo&list=PL2zq7klxX5ASFejJj80ob9ZAnBHdz5O1t&ab_channel=KenJee\nKaggle Projects: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5AQXzNSLtc_LEKFPh2mAvHIO"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en-US"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "33071", "likeCount": "763", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "99"}}

You can do this by getting user feedback, re-training and evaluating, and testing your models continuously on real world data. \n\nDangers of Social Media: https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44640959\nhttps://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0894439316660340\n#DataScience #KenJee \n\n⭕ Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/kenjee1?sub_confirmation=1\n🎙 Listen to My Podcast: https://www.youtube.com/c/KensNearestNeighborsPodcast\n🕸 Check out My Website - https://kennethjee.com/\n✍️Sign up for My Newsletter - https://www.kennethjee.com/newsletter\n📚 Books and Products I use -  https://www.amazon.com/shop/kenjee (affiliate link)\n\nPartners & Affiliates \n🌟 365 Data Science - Courses ( 57% Annual Discount): https://365datascience.pxf.io/P0jbBY\n🌟 Interview Query - https://www.interviewquery.com/?ref=kenjee\n\nMORE DATA SCIENCE CONTENT HERE:\n🐤My Twitter - https://twitter.com/KenJee_DS\n👔 LinkedIn -  https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenjee/\n📈 Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/kenjee\n📑 Medium Articles - https://medium.com/@kenneth.b.jee\n💻 Github - https://github.com/PlayingNumbers\n🏀 My Sports Blog -https://www.playingnumbers.com\n\nCheck These Videos Out Next! \nMy Leaderboard Project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myhoWUrSP7o&ab_channel=KenJee\n66 Days of Data: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV_AlRwhI3I&ab_channel=KenJee\nHow I Would Learn Data Science in 2021: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Clrh6nv1s&ab_channel=KenJee\n\nMy Playlists \nData Science Beginners: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5ATMsmyRazei7ZXkP1GHt-vs\nProject From Scratch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpF9HENQjDo&list=PL2zq7klxX5ASFejJj80ob9ZAnBHdz5O1t&ab_channel=KenJee\nKaggle Projects: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5AQXzNSLtc_LEKFPh2mAvHIO"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en-US"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "1858", "likeCount": "105", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "30"}}

This learning philosophy is based off of Scott Young's book ultralearning (linked below). Scott used this approach to learn the entire undergrad MIT Computer Science curriculum in a single year (and pass all the exams). Ultralearning has 9 principles and I show you how you can apply many of them to data science. \n\nUltralearning Book: https://amzn.to/33LTvYf\n*This is an amazon affiliate link. The couple cents I get from your purchase go to paying off my student loans, so buying is greatly appreciated! This is at no cost to you! \n\nPrinciple 1: Metalearning - Plan your learning journey. Think about your data science goal and create a roadmap to get here. This should take up to 10% of your total learning time. If you want to become a data scientist, you need to learn programming and math. Figure out exactly what concepts you need to know from each disciplines.\nFor learning Coding: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VN12ZPFsApM\nFor learning Math: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSwM5uVeylU\n\nPrinciple 2: Focus - To stick to your data science learning plan, you should train yourself to focus. This is a learned skill. You should pay careful attention to your environment and schedule your time wisely. \nVideo on data science focus: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akbU9KOo_Qc\n\nPrinciple 3: Directness - This is my favorite one.

I also recommend reaching out to your friends who are data scientists or people in your network to get feedback on your projects.

With this, we can use transfer learning to produce a good result with little additional training. \n\ngithub repo: https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ball_image_classifier\nfastai course repo: https://github.com/fastai/course-v3/blob/master/nbs/dl1/lesson2-download.ipynb\nfastai course: https://www.fast.ai/\nfatkun plugin for image downloads: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fatkun-batch-download-ima/nnjjahlikiabnchcpehcpkdeckfgnohf?hl=en\n\n#DataScience #KenJee #SportsAnalytics #DataScienceProject\n\n⭕ Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/kenjee1?sub_confirmation=1\n🎙 Listen to My Podcast: https://www.youtube.com/c/KensNearestNeighborsPodcast\n🕸 Check out My Website - https://kennethjee.com/\n✍️Sign up for My Newsletter - https://www.kennethjee.com/newsletter\n📚 Books and Products I use -  https://www.amazon.com/shop/kenjee (affiliate link)\n\nPartners & Affiliates \n🌟 365 Data Science - Courses ( 57% Annual Discount): https://365datascience.pxf.io/P0jbBY\n🌟 Interview Query - https://www.interviewquery.com/?ref=kenjee\n\nMORE DATA SCIENCE CONTENT HERE:\n🐤My Twitter - https://twitter.com/KenJee_DS\n👔 LinkedIn -  https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenjee/\n📈 Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/kenjee\n📑 Medium Articles - https://medium.com/@kenneth.b.jee\n💻 Github - https://github.com/PlayingNumbers\n🏀 My Sports Blog -https://www.playingnumbers.com\n\nCheck These Videos Out Next! \nMy Leaderboard Project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myhoWUrSP7o&ab_channel=KenJee\n66 Days of Data: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV_AlRwhI3I&ab_channel=KenJee\nHow I Would Learn Data Science in 2021: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Clrh6nv1s&ab_channel=KenJee\n\nMy Playlists \nData Science Beginners: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5ATMsmyRazei7ZXkP1GHt-vs\nProject From Scratch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpF9HENQjDo&list=PL2zq7klxX5ASFejJj80ob9ZAnBHdz5O1t&ab_channel=KenJee\nKaggle Projects: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5AQXzNSLtc_LEKFPh2mAvHIO"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en-US"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "14893", "likeCount": "481", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "45"}}

Most people get stuck here because they don't know where to start. To get to the next stage, you should narrow the boundaries and start with a small data science project. Learn the necessary skills to complete that task, then move on to another small one. You should also go on kaggle and review code of other data scientists. Keep a log of all the terms, algorithms, and packages that you don't know.\n\nStage 3: Conscious Competence (Slightly Dangerous) - Here you will have had a few projects under your belt. You will now be able to reuse your python or r code. This is where you truly learn data science. You should do as many projects as you can and learn to code data science algorithms from scratch. \n\nStage 4: Unconscious Competence (Art Form) - At this stage, you know how to solve problems as they come along. You don't have to refer to your data science scripts, and you can start focusing on producing results. Here, you start to focus on optimizing your models.\n\nStage 5: Mastery (Contribution) - While I don't believe that anyone has mastered data science, I believe that you reach this data science learning stage by contributing to the field in a meaningful way.

Seek the input from data scientists and give them feedback.\n\n#DataScience #KenJee \n\n⭕ Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/kenjee1?sub_confirmation=1\n🎙 Listen to My Podcast: https://www.youtube.com/c/KensNearestNeighborsPodcast\n🕸 Check out My Website - https://kennethjee.com/\n✍️Sign up for My Newsletter - https://www.kennethjee.com/newsletter\n📚 Books and Products I use -  https://www.amazon.com/shop/kenjee (affiliate link)\n\nPartners & Affiliates \n🌟 365 Data Science - Courses ( 57% Annual Discount): https://365datascience.pxf.io/P0jbBY\n🌟 Interview Query - https://www.interviewquery.com/?ref=kenjee\n\nMORE DATA SCIENCE CONTENT HERE:\n🐤My Twitter - https://twitter.com/KenJee_DS\n👔 LinkedIn -  https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenjee/\n📈 Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/kenjee\n📑 Medium Articles - https://medium.com/@kenneth.b.jee\n💻 Github - https://github.com/PlayingNumbers\n🏀 My Sports Blog -https://www.playingnumbers.com\n\nCheck These Videos Out Next! \nMy Leaderboard Project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myhoWUrSP7o&ab_channel=KenJee\n66 Days of Data: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV_AlRwhI3I&ab_channel=KenJee\nHow I Would Learn Data Science in 2021: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Clrh6nv1s&ab_channel=KenJee\n\nMy Playlists \nData Science Beginners: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5ATMsmyRazei7ZXkP1GHt-vs\nProject From Scratch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpF9HENQjDo&list=PL2zq7klxX5ASFejJj80ob9ZAnBHdz5O1t&ab_channel=KenJee\nKaggle Projects: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5AQXzNSLtc_LEKFPh2mAvHIO"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en-US"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "3983", "likeCount": "150", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "18"}}

I also use a linear regression and a logistic regression to determine if trash can bangs have predictive power over runs and wins. \n\nShockingly the correlation and linear regression suggested that there was very little relationship between bangs and runs scored.

If the Astros were mainly cheating when they were behind, this would likely not show in the models we built before. I also looked at the number of bangs in games when the Astros were down early. I found that there is a large spike in bangs when they are down in the first 3 innings. \n\nTo see if this had a meaningful impact, I looked at their win % for games when they were behind by inning.

There are very few college students that land Data Science Jobs right out of school. These are my tips to maximize your university experience and to give you the best career options going forward. \n\n1) Get as much experience as you can.

You should not become a data scientist if the three pillars above are relevant to you! \n\n#DataScience #KenJee \n\n⭕ Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/kenjee1?sub_confirmation=1\n🎙 Listen to My Podcast: https://www.youtube.com/c/KensNearestNeighborsPodcast\n🕸 Check out My Website - https://kennethjee.com/\n✍️Sign up for My Newsletter - https://www.kennethjee.com/newsletter\n📚 Books and Products I use -  https://www.amazon.com/shop/kenjee (affiliate link)\n\nPartners & Affiliates \n🌟 365 Data Science - Courses ( 57% Annual Discount): https://365datascience.pxf.io/P0jbBY\n🌟 Interview Query - https://www.interviewquery.com/?ref=kenjee\n\nMORE DATA SCIENCE CONTENT HERE:\n🐤My Twitter - https://twitter.com/KenJee_DS\n👔 LinkedIn -  https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenjee/\n📈 Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/kenjee\n📑 Medium Articles - https://medium.com/@kenneth.b.jee\n💻 Github - https://github.com/PlayingNumbers\n🏀 My Sports Blog -https://www.playingnumbers.com\n\nCheck These Videos Out Next! \nMy Leaderboard Project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myhoWUrSP7o&ab_channel=KenJee\n66 Days of Data: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV_AlRwhI3I&ab_channel=KenJee\nHow I Would Learn Data Science in 2021: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Clrh6nv1s&ab_channel=KenJee\n\nMy Playlists \nData Science Beginners: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5ATMsmyRazei7ZXkP1GHt-vs\nProject From Scratch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpF9HENQjDo&list=PL2zq7klxX5ASFejJj80ob9ZAnBHdz5O1t&ab_channel=KenJee\nKaggle Projects: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5AQXzNSLtc_LEKFPh2mAvHIO"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en-US"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "101302", "likeCount": "2883", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "200"}}

With these two inputs we can very accurately approximate the win % of a baseball season. \n\nThe equation for this is (runs scored)^2 / ((runs scored)^2 + (runs against)^2)\n\nIf we can reliably project the expected runs scored and runs scored against for the next season, we can reliably extrapolate that to how many games they are expected to win. \n\nWit this we can also evaluate how much of a positive or negative impact a new player will have on a team. We can predict the number of runs that a new player will create. With this formula, we are able to predict the number of wins that this accounts for.

With these two inputs we can very accurately approximate the win % of a baseball season. \n\nThe equation for this is (runs scored)^2 / ((runs scored)^2 + (runs against)^2)\n\nIf we can reliably project the expected runs scored and runs scored against for the next season, we can reliably extrapolate that to how many games they are expected to win. \n\nWit this we can also evaluate how much of a positive or negative impact a new player will have on a team. We can predict the number of runs that a new player will create. With this formula, we are able to predict the number of wins that this accounts for. This is extremely important for teams when they are evaluating trades and valuing players. They can determine how much a player is worth based on the wins that they contribute. \n\nThis equation can be related to other sports as well, although it is slightly less accurate.

Data Science has a steep learning curve. You also have to invest in learning after getting a job or finishing school.\n\n- Can you identify problems and seek out solutions? People will not tell you how to solve every problem. You have to be creative enough to identify problems and generate custom solutions to them\n\n- Do you have an aptitude for math? The foundation of data science is in math. You need to be comfortable with this to excel in the field.\n\n- Are you interested in computer science and programming? Most day to day data science work requires programming. You must be comfortable learning these techniques. \n\n- Do you have a knack for story telling and explaining complex concepts in simple terms? You commonly have to explain your findings to business holders.

They just want to know that you have baseline abilities. If you want to impress them, use an ensemble model or use some feature engineering. \n- In person, speak about the outcomes of your projects. Make sure you communicate why you worked on them and the potential value they could create for a business.\n\n#KenJee \n\n⭕ Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/kenjee1?sub_confirmation=1\n🎙 Listen to My Podcast: https://www.youtube.com/c/KensNearestNeighborsPodcast\n🕸 Check out My Website - https://kennethjee.com/\n✍️Sign up for My Newsletter - https://www.kennethjee.com/newsletter\n📚 Books and Products I use -  https://www.amazon.com/shop/kenjee (affiliate link)\n\nPartners & Affiliates \n🌟 365 Data Science - Courses ( 57% Annual Discount): https://365datascience.pxf.io/P0jbBY\n🌟 Interview Query - https://www.interviewquery.com/?ref=kenjee\n\nMORE DATA SCIENCE CONTENT HERE:\n🐤My Twitter - https://twitter.com/KenJee_DS\n👔 LinkedIn -  https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenjee/\n📈 Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/kenjee\n📑 Medium Articles - https://medium.com/@kenneth.b.jee\n💻 Github - https://github.com/PlayingNumbers\n🏀 My Sports Blog -https://www.playingnumbers.com\n\nCheck These Videos Out Next! \nMy Leaderboard Project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myhoWUrSP7o&ab_channel=KenJee\n66 Days of Data: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV_AlRwhI3I&ab_channel=KenJee\nHow I Would Learn Data Science in 2021: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Clrh6nv1s&ab_channel=KenJee\n\nMy Playlists \nData Science Beginners: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5ATMsmyRazei7ZXkP1GHt-vs\nProject From Scratch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpF9HENQjDo&list=PL2zq7klxX5ASFejJj80ob9ZAnBHdz5O1t&ab_channel=KenJee\nKaggle Projects: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5AQXzNSLtc_LEKFPh2mAvHIO"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "27820", "likeCount": "1279", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "89"}}

I also would have leveraged the networks that I developed.\n\n#DataScience #GraduateSchool\n#KenJee \n\n⭕ Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/c/kenjee1?sub_confirmation=1\n🎙 Listen to My Podcast: https://www.youtube.com/c/KensNearestNeighborsPodcast\n🕸 Check out My Website - https://kennethjee.com/\n✍️Sign up for My Newsletter - https://www.kennethjee.com/newsletter\n📚 Books and Products I use -  https://www.amazon.com/shop/kenjee (affiliate link)\n\nPartners & Affiliates \n🌟 365 Data Science - Courses ( 57% Annual Discount): https://365datascience.pxf.io/P0jbBY\n🌟 Interview Query - https://www.interviewquery.com/?ref=kenjee\n\nMORE DATA SCIENCE CONTENT HERE:\n🐤My Twitter - https://twitter.com/KenJee_DS\n👔 LinkedIn -  https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenjee/\n📈 Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/kenjee\n📑 Medium Articles - https://medium.com/@kenneth.b.jee\n💻 Github - https://github.com/PlayingNumbers\n🏀 My Sports Blog -https://www.playingnumbers.com\n\nCheck These Videos Out Next! \nMy Leaderboard Project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myhoWUrSP7o&ab_channel=KenJee\n66 Days of Data: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV_AlRwhI3I&ab_channel=KenJee\nHow I Would Learn Data Science in 2021: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41Clrh6nv1s&ab_channel=KenJee\n\nMy Playlists \nData Science Beginners: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5ATMsmyRazei7ZXkP1GHt-vs\nProject From Scratch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpF9HENQjDo&list=PL2zq7klxX5ASFejJj80ob9ZAnBHdz5O1t&ab_channel=KenJee\nKaggle Projects: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5AQXzNSLtc_LEKFPh2mAvHIO"}, "defaultAudioLanguage": "en"}, "statistics": {"viewCount": "1324", "likeCount": "59", "favoriteCount": "0", "commentCount": "12"}}
