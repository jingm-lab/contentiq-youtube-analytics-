And fair enough.\n\nRather than answering everyone individually, here is my view (I am just the film-maker, not a mathematician) \n- Brady \n↓↓↓\n\n1. Because it is fun and creative - and playing with new ideas is good for your brain. \n2. Because you never know what \"bending the rules\" will teach you - what techniques, insights and breakthroughs will occur that may have more useful applications... Just look at much of John Conway's work... So much playfulness and so many games - yet many ideas and insightful mathematics has fallen out of that. \n\nLunar arithmetic is never going to be used to build a bridge or design an iPhone (I certainly hope not!!!)... But neither is it just throwing ALL rules out of the window... It is creating a new arbitrary set of rules and seeing what happens... \n\nWhat IS a prime number in this new landscape? What pattern do the squares follow? And what light might that shed on more conventional mathematics? \n\nAlso... If you are not buying that and think it's just nonsensical playing...

And fair enough.\n\nRather than answering everyone individually, here is my view (I am just the film-maker, not a mathematician) \n- Brady \n↓↓↓\n\n1. Because it is fun and creative - and playing with new ideas is good for your brain. \n2. Because you never know what \"bending the rules\" will teach you - what techniques, insights and breakthroughs will occur that may have more useful applications... Just look at much of John Conway's work... So much playfulness and so many games - yet many ideas and insightful mathematics has fallen out of that. \n\nLunar arithmetic is never going to be used to build a bridge or design an iPhone (I certainly hope not!!!)... But neither is it just throwing ALL rules out of the window... It is creating a new arbitrary set of rules and seeing what happens... \n\nWhat IS a prime number in this new landscape?

The numbers I use are based on Planck 2013 data. Data from the 2015 release exists but I chose the 2013 data since the precise calculation of the size of the universe has only been done explicitly in that case as per this paper: http://www.isaacpub.org/images/PaperPDF/AdAp_100039_2016122914005354452.pdf\n\n2. Near the start I say I’m only considering fundamental particles with mass, and not, say, photons. Actually, I don’t count neutrinos either since they too are relativistic, and the precise results are model dependent to an extent.\n\n3 (later addendum). Well done to anyone who spotted the fact that the 75:25% split between H and He ought to be by mass, and not by number of atoms, as in the video. I realised this mistake lying in bed on the night the video was released and kicked myself repeatedly! Very annoying. Anyway, correcting for this, we see that there actually ought to be 12 H atoms for each He atom, since the atom mass of He is 4, and the total atomic mass of 12 H atoms is 12=3x4.   Following the same sort of logic as in the video, we find that  there are 62=12x4+14 particles for 16=12+4 baryons. Thats means we should have multiplied by 62/16 rather than 26/7, and so our result should be corrected by a factor of 1.04, yielding closer to 3.4 x 10^80 particles. [Of course, no-one really worries about factors of 1.04 in cosmology :)].
