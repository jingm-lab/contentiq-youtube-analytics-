The oceans are a nearly unlimited resource of water with this seemingly trivial caveat, which is that the water is just a little bit salty.

FDOT declined to comment, and Superior Construction did not respond to multiple emails.\n\nBarrier islands are critical to protecting mainland coasts by absorbing wave energy and bearing the brunt of storms. But development on the islands negates that critical purpose. That doesn’t mean the community doesn’t belong there. But it does obligate the planners and engineers involved in rebuilding to be thoughtful about the impacts hurricanes can have and how infrastructure can be made more resilient to them in the future.\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.

And, like all human endeavors, rigging is prone to error. Some of the most serious crane failures in history had nothing to do with the crane itself but were actually a result of poor rigging. There’s a lot that can go wrong below the hook, so in this video, we’re going to take a look at a few of the fundamentals in attaching and securing a load and some of the hidden hazards that can pop up if not done properly and carefully.\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.

And, like all human endeavors, rigging is prone to error. Some of the most serious crane failures in history had nothing to do with the crane itself but were actually a result of poor rigging. There’s a lot that can go wrong below the hook, so in this video, we’re going to take a look at a few of the fundamentals in attaching and securing a load and some of the hidden hazards that can pop up if not done properly and carefully.\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.

Behold: the garduino. My brother got me an arduino microcontroller board for Christmas, which to me was a solution looking for a problem. I finally found the problem: fresh herbs are expensive at the grocery store. But apparently not as expensive as adding a bunch of sensors and electronics to your garden.\n\nBuild one yourself or just poke around in the code: https://github.com/gradyh/GradyHillhouseGarduino.git\n\nThanks to my brother, Graham, for the Arduino board and editing the narration. Thanks to Chris from YouTube channel AvE (https://www.youtube.com/user/arduinoversusevil) for the tips on soil moisture sensors and water hammer. Most of the parts in this build came from http://www.adafruit.com.\n\nCombining microcontrollers and gardening is a really popular idea. I think that’s because gardens have very simple inputs and outputs that are easy to wrap your head around. I guess people (myself included) see a notoriously simple and relaxed hobby and can’t help but feel compelled to overcomplicate it. But just about anyone can connect the dots between \"Garden needs water\" and \"I am not a responsible human being who is capable of remembering to water a garden every day\" and realize, \"Hey, I can use technology to overcome my personal shortcomings,\" and more than that, \"I can bend technology to my will and that will feel good to my ego and my sense of self-worth.\" After all, no one’s hobby is to buy an irrigation controller off the shelf of a hardware store. Thanks for watching, and let me know what you think.\n\nA few technical details below... If there's anything I didn't address, feel free to shoot me a question in the comments.\n\nMoisture sensors that measure the resistance or conductivity across the soil matrix between two contacts are essentially junk. First of all, resistance is not a very good indicator of moisture content, because it is highly dependent on a number of factors which might vary from garden to garden including soil ph, dissolved solids in the water, and temperature. Second, most of them are of poor quality with contacts that easily corrode. For the most part you'd be lucky to get one to last through an entire season. Capacitive sensors are generally more accurate because they are just measuring the change in dialetric properties of the soil which is less sensitive to other environmental factors. They also don't require any exposed conductive surfaces which means they can last a bit longer in the harsh environment of your backyard. My soil moisture sensor (and soil temperature sensor) came from http://www.vegetronix.com.\n\nThe arudino’s analog inputs read voltage, so to use a resistive sensor (like the photoresistor I used to measure sunlight), you have to set up a voltage divider. This is just a really simple circuit which divides the voltage drop between your sensor and a known resistor. You know the current is the same for both, so you can calculate the resistance of your sensor using ohm’s law. The only problem here is that a photoresistor’s relationship to illuminance is log-log, that is to say it spans several orders of magnitude. So if you use a big resistor (5k - 10k ohm) in your voltage divider, your sensor will be sensitive to low light levels, but you won’t be able to tell the difference between a sunny day and an overcast one. Since this thing’s going outside, I used a 100 ohm resistor, which should hopefully give me good differentiation between levels of brightness in the daylight.\n\nMusic from incompotech.com", "thumbnails": {"default": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/O_Q1WKCtWiA/default.jpg", "width": 120, "height": 90}, "medium": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/O_Q1WKCtWiA/mqdefault.jpg", "width": 320, "height": 180}, "high": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/O_Q1WKCtWiA/hqdefault.jpg", "width": 480, "height": 360}, "standard": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/O_Q1WKCtWiA/sddefault.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "maxres": {"url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/O_Q1WKCtWiA/maxresdefault.jpg", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "channelTitle": "Practical Engineering", "tags": ["garduino", "arduino garden", "automatic garden", "automatic watering", "soil moisture", "arduino garden project", "gardening", "arduino"], "categoryId": "28", "liveBroadcastContent": "none", "defaultLanguage": "en", "localized": {"title": "Arduino Garden Controller - Automatic Watering and Data Logging", "description": "Gardening in the modern age means making things more complicated and arduous, with electrons, bits, and bytes.

Tire width goes into estimating pass-to-coverage ratio in pavement design to estimate load repetitions. For rigid pavements, it's measured at the surface. For flexible pavements, it's measured at the top of the subgrade. For rigid pavement, the fatigue concern is maximum tensile stress at the bottom of the PCC slab. That bottom stress is governed mainly by slab bending mechanics and load position. A small lateral shift can change the critical bottom stress a lot, so the “near-maximum response” region doesn’t expand the same way it does with a flexible pavement.\n\nSome of the construction techniques and engineering requirements for runways that you don’t really notice when you’re a passenger looking through the window\n\nWatch this video ad-free on Nebula: https://nebula.tv/videos/practical-engineering-the-hidden-engineering-of-runways\n\nSigned copies of my book (plus other cool stuff) are available here: https://store.practical.engineering/\n\nPractical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.
