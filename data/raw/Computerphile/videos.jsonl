The PDP11/34s were more than a 'graphics card' they were Radar Display Processors which handled selection of the required radar data streams from the 12 odd available and also handled the inputs from the various control panels on the controller suite. The 11/34s originally drove as Sector Equipment Group which converted the digital data to vector data to drive the original displays, once the Ericsson displays where introduced they had the SEG functionality built in and were therefore driven directly by the 11/34.

I chose matlab because it's a popular tool for\n% quickly prototyping things. Matlab licenses are pricey, if you don't have\n% one (or, like me, work for an organisation that does) try Octave as a\n% good free alternative. This code should work in Octave too.\n\n% Load in an input image\nim = imread('C:\\Path\\Of\\Input\\Image.jpg');\n\n% In matlab, K-means operates on a 2D array, where each sample is one row,\n% and the features are the columns. We can use the reshape function to turn\n% the image into this format, where each pixel is one row, and R,G and B\n% are the columns. We are turning a W,H,3 image into W*H,3\n\n% We also cast to a double array, because K-means requires it in matlab\nimflat = double(reshape(im, size(im,1) * size(im,2), 3));\n\n% I specify that initialisation shuold sample points at\n% random, rather than anything complex like kmeans++ initialisation.\n% Kmeans++ takes a long time if you are using 256 classes.\n\n% Perform k-means. This function returns the class IDs assigned to each\n% pixel, and in this case we also want the mean values for each class -\n% what colour is each class. This can take a long time if the value for K\n% is large, I've used the sampling start strategy to speed things up.\n\n% While KMeans is running, it will show you the iteration count, and the\n% number of pixels that have changed class since last iteration. This\n% number should get lower and lower, as the means settle on appropriate\n% values. For large K, it's unlikely that we will ever reach zero movement\n% (convergence) within 150 iterations.\nK = 3\n[kIDs, kC] = kmeans(imflat, K, 'Display', 'iter', 'MaxIter', 150, 'Start', 'sample');\n\n% Matlab can output paletted images, that is, grayscale images where the\n% colours are stored in a separate array. This array is kC, and kIDs are\n% the grayscale indices.\ncolormap = kC / 256; % Scale 0-1, since this is what matlab wants\n\n% Reshape kIDs back into the original image shape\nimout = reshape(uint8(kIDs), size(im,1), size(im,2));\n\n% Save file out, you need to subtract 1 from the image classes, since once\n% stored in the file the values should go from 0-255, not 1-256 like matlab\n% would do.\nimwrite(imout - 1, colormap, 'C:\\Path\\Of\\Output\\Image.png');\n\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/computerphile\nhttps://twitter.com/computer_phile\n\nThis video was filmed and edited by Sean Riley.\n\nComputer Science at the University of Nottingham: http://bit.ly/nottscomputer\n\nComputerphile is a sister project to Brady Haran's Numberphile.

Dr Mike Pound explains how it works.\n\nFire Pong in Detail: https://youtu.be/ZoZMMg1r_Oc \nDeep Dream: https://youtu.be/BsSmBPmPeYQ \nFPS & Digital Video: https://youtu.be/yniSnYtkrwQ \n\nDr. Mike's Code: \n% This script is the one mentioned during the Computerphile Image\n% Segmentation video. I chose matlab because it's a popular tool for\n% quickly prototyping things. Matlab licenses are pricey, if you don't have\n% one (or, like me, work for an organisation that does) try Octave as a\n% good free alternative. This code should work in Octave too.\n\n% Load in an input image\nim = imread('C:\\Path\\Of\\Input\\Image.jpg');\n\n% In matlab, K-means operates on a 2D array, where each sample is one row,\n% and the features are the columns. We can use the reshape function to turn\n% the image into this format, where each pixel is one row, and R,G and B\n% are the columns. We are turning a W,H,3 image into W*H,3\n\n% We also cast to a double array, because K-means requires it in matlab\nimflat = double(reshape(im, size(im,1) * size(im,2), 3));\n\n% I specify that initialisation shuold sample points at\n% random, rather than anything complex like kmeans++ initialisation.\n% Kmeans++ takes a long time if you are using 256 classes.\n\n% Perform k-means. This function returns the class IDs assigned to each\n% pixel, and in this case we also want the mean values for each class -\n% what colour is each class. This can take a long time if the value for K\n% is large, I've used the sampling start strategy to speed things up.\n\n% While KMeans is running, it will show you the iteration count, and the\n% number of pixels that have changed class since last iteration. This\n% number should get lower and lower, as the means settle on appropriate\n% values. For large K, it's unlikely that we will ever reach zero movement\n% (convergence) within 150 iterations.\nK = 3\n[kIDs, kC] = kmeans(imflat, K, 'Display', 'iter', 'MaxIter', 150, 'Start', 'sample');\n\n% Matlab can output paletted images, that is, grayscale images where the\n% colours are stored in a separate array. This array is kC, and kIDs are\n% the grayscale indices.\ncolormap = kC / 256; % Scale 0-1, since this is what matlab wants\n\n% Reshape kIDs back into the original image shape\nimout = reshape(uint8(kIDs), size(im,1), size(im,2));\n\n% Save file out, you need to subtract 1 from the image classes, since once\n% stored in the file the values should go from 0-255, not 1-256 like matlab\n% would do.\nimwrite(imout - 1, colormap, 'C:\\Path\\Of\\Output\\Image.png');\n\n\nhttp://www.facebook.com/computerphile\nhttps://twitter.com/computer_phile\n\nThis video was filmed and edited by Sean Riley.\n\nComputer Science at the University of Nottingham: http://bit.ly/nottscomputer\n\nComputerphile is a sister project to Brady Haran's Numberphile.
