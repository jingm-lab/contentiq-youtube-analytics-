Thank you sir.\n\nThe Thunderbirds have a YouTube Channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_edytVWM8iumngqzTVLVw\n\nThis flight took place on May 3, 2019 in Biloxi Mississippi.  The reason it took so long to release is the high amount of research I wanted to do before releasing the video.  I even visited the Air Force Research Lab at Wright Patterson AFB to discuss some aspects of this video with Aerodynamicists.  Synchronizing all this footage and coordinating additional B Roll with the Thunderbirds Public Affairs Officer also required a lot of effort.  \n\nThese are my own thoughts, not those of the U.S. Air Force or the Thunderbirds:\nI've been around a lot of pilots and ground crew in my life and I must say that the professionalism displayed by the Thunderbirds was astounding.  Their goal is to inspire and demonstrate the capabilities of the US Air Force, so I'll take it a step further.  If you're a smart young person who is interesting in changing your life for the better, strongly consider the Air Force.  The job market isn't the best at the moment but the Air Force still has opportunities available for you to learn incredible skills even if you're not interested in flying.  They manage everything from logistics, electronics, aerospace, cyber and even space systems.  The threats to freedom are becoming more complex, and in my experience working for the Department of Defense over a 15 year span (even longer if you count my work as a contractor) The US Air Force consists of some of the most intelligent service members our country has.  These people are book-smart, but also have the confidence to solve real world problems with their own hands.  If I have a complex aerodynamic question, my first call is usually to someone in the Air Force, because they understand these complex phenomena intuitively.  For example, in this video you would hear Flack and I talking about pitot tubes in flight.  We also had other discussions about fuel burn rates, Prandtl Glauert, weather.... all kinds of things.  Simply put, if you're looking for direction in your life, and you're good with science and math... consider the Air Force.  That being said, they also need other types of skills as well.  Logisticians, writers, creative people who know how to solve complex problems in unique ways.  \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET SMARTER SECTION\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prandtl%E2%80%93Glauert_transformation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nGET STUFF SECTION: \n(If I did this right these should be working Amazon affiliate links to purchase the stuff I like  to use.

Thank you sir.\n\nThe Thunderbirds have a YouTube Channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7_edytVWM8iumngqzTVLVw\n\nThis flight took place on May 3, 2019 in Biloxi Mississippi.  The reason it took so long to release is the high amount of research I wanted to do before releasing the video.  I even visited the Air Force Research Lab at Wright Patterson AFB to discuss some aspects of this video with Aerodynamicists.  Synchronizing all this footage and coordinating additional B Roll with the Thunderbirds Public Affairs Officer also required a lot of effort.  \n\nThese are my own thoughts, not those of the U.S. Air Force or the Thunderbirds:\nI've been around a lot of pilots and ground crew in my life and I must say that the professionalism displayed by the Thunderbirds was astounding.  Their goal is to inspire and demonstrate the capabilities of the US Air Force, so I'll take it a step further.  If you're a smart young person who is interesting in changing your life for the better, strongly consider the Air Force.  The job market isn't the best at the moment but the Air Force still has opportunities available for you to learn incredible skills even if you're not interested in flying.  They manage everything from logistics, electronics, aerospace, cyber and even space systems.  The threats to freedom are becoming more complex, and in my experience working for the Department of Defense over a 15 year span (even longer if you count my work as a contractor) The US Air Force consists of some of the most intelligent service members our country has.  These people are book-smart, but also have the confidence to solve real world problems with their own hands.  If I have a complex aerodynamic question, my first call is usually to someone in the Air Force, because they understand these complex phenomena intuitively.  For example, in this video you would hear Flack and I talking about pitot tubes in flight.  We also had other discussions about fuel burn rates, Prandtl Glauert, weather.... all kinds of things.  Simply put, if you're looking for direction in your life, and you're good with science and math... consider the Air Force.  That being said, they also need other types of skills as well.  Logisticians, writers, creative people who know how to solve complex problems in unique ways.  \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET SMARTER SECTION\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prandtl%E2%80%93Glauert_transformation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nGET STUFF SECTION: \n(If I did this right these should be working Amazon affiliate links to purchase the stuff I like  to use.

A major mission of Hudson Alpha is to educate the public and promote genomics literacy.  I talked to many scientists about Genotyping but Dr. Lamb's ability to break down the complexity of the human genome is what finally brought it home for me.  Hudson Alpha provides many opportunities for Genomics Education and \n Hudson Alpha is http://hudsonalpha.org/ for explaining the difference between Genotyping and Sequencing.  To contact a super smart Genomics Professional at Hudson Alpha click here: hudsonalpha.org/contact \n\nGenotyping and Sequencing are very different:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing#DNA_sequencing\n\nThe 23andMe Genotyping service is provided by LabCorp\nAccording to their website, LabCorp is \"The World's Leading Health Care Diagnostics Company\"\nhttps://www.labcorp.com/\n\nNo Private or Health Information about any individual was recorded or shared in the making of this video (This video is HIPAA compliant).\n\nA special thanks to the Lab Manager Amanda Douglas for being a complete science rock star and a great person to work with  I spoke with about a dozen LabCorp Employees who are under Amanda and every one said she was an absolute joy to work for.  I know my experience working with her great and I hope her boss reads this blurb I wrote down here in the video description and gives her a high five and a big fat bonus or something equally as awesome.\n\n23andMe provide Genotyping testing using an Illumina HumanOmniExpress-24 format chip.  Here's a bit about the chip.

A major mission of Hudson Alpha is to educate the public and promote genomics literacy.  I talked to many scientists about Genotyping but Dr. Lamb's ability to break down the complexity of the human genome is what finally brought it home for me.  Hudson Alpha provides many opportunities for Genomics Education and \n Hudson Alpha is http://hudsonalpha.org/ for explaining the difference between Genotyping and Sequencing.  To contact a super smart Genomics Professional at Hudson Alpha click here: hudsonalpha.org/contact \n\nGenotyping and Sequencing are very different:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing#DNA_sequencing\n\nThe 23andMe Genotyping service is provided by LabCorp\nAccording to their website, LabCorp is \"The World's Leading Health Care Diagnostics Company\"\nhttps://www.labcorp.com/\n\nNo Private or Health Information about any individual was recorded or shared in the making of this video (This video is HIPAA compliant).\n\nA special thanks to the Lab Manager Amanda Douglas for being a complete science rock star and a great person to work with  I spoke with about a dozen LabCorp Employees who are under Amanda and every one said she was an absolute joy to work for.  I know my experience working with her great and I hope her boss reads this blurb I wrote down here in the video description and gives her a high five and a big fat bonus or something equally as awesome.\n\n23andMe provide Genotyping testing using an Illumina HumanOmniExpress-24 format chip.  Here's a bit about the chip.

We used two songs from other artists (licensed of course). Derek split the first one up so it fades from video to video, and Gordon split the instruments up on the second one.  There are violins on one video and percussion on the other for example.  It's really neat.\n\nThe neat earth animation at the beginning and the synchronizing timer was made by http://eisenfeuer.com/. He also made still images of the earth from the top and the bottom.\n\nThanks to Jacob Vehrs for helping make the plywood pool platform.\n\nGET SMARTER SECTION:\n\nThere was a study performed at MIT years ago (http://web.mit.edu/hml/ncfmf/09VOR.pdf) that explained the physics involved.

We used two songs from other artists (licensed of course). Derek split the first one up so it fades from video to video, and Gordon split the instruments up on the second one.  There are violins on one video and percussion on the other for example.  It's really neat.\n\nThe neat earth animation at the beginning and the synchronizing timer was made by http://eisenfeuer.com/. He also made still images of the earth from the top and the bottom.\n\nThanks to Jacob Vehrs for helping make the plywood pool platform.\n\nGET SMARTER SECTION:\n\nThere was a study performed at MIT years ago (http://web.mit.edu/hml/ncfmf/09VOR.pdf) that explained the physics involved.  We repeated some of these demonstrations, but on opposite sides of the globe…and in a way that can be easily understood.\nThis site is a great resource on the Coriolis effect and ways people have gotten it wrong:\nhttp://www.ems.psu.edu/~fraser/Bad/BadCoriolis.html\n\nThe Coriolis Effect influences the flight of a bullet.\nhttp://www-das.uwyo.edu/~geerts/cwx/notes/chap11/artillery.html\n\nWe would love for someone to replicate this demonstration.

We have busy lives so often she wouldn't say anything.  If one reached out and grabbed her attention (I try to apply only enough for her to smell me when she's close... not like a high school boy who pours it on) I knew it was an interesting scent to her.  I tried to be honest, so many times I would wear one an entire day without a single comment from her.  That was pretty hard to do because I was hungry for data.  Sometimes if the mood was right and we were getting ready or something I'd casually ask what she thought about a certain fragrance.  She's conducted serious biological research projects before so she understood all along the importance of the data set.\n\nSome colognes I only tried once because it was obvious one of us hated it.  Others were kind of in the \"whatever\" region.  Those I would often try multiple times.  Some she really liked one day, but not another.  Those took multiple tries to weed out.  \n\nOften I would go without wearing anything, or perhaps my old aftershave just to make sure she wasn't gaming the system.  The first or second day or so I realized that if she knew the names of the colognes it DRASTICALLY influenced her opinions.  That just goes to show you how powerful marketing is on our perceptions. \n\nAt some points she got confused because she couldn't tell if I was re-wearing something I had tried earlier.  For example, she became a bit self conscious about whether or not she had already told me she liked one...   I could tell she was trying to give me consistent answers, but I kept shifting it up so much I filtered out all her attempts to game the data.  \n\nI also noticed that if I wore one that she complimented or mentioned without being prompted.\n\nIn the end, I'm really happy with what we chose.  It's light and a bit sweet, but still has swagger to it.  I fancy myself a manly man, and I think she likes that about me.  If you want to try to pull the answer out of her, I'm sure she would get a kick out of that. Tweet her at https://twitter.com/DestinsBride and see if you can talk her out of the answer.

I became instantly fascinated and commissioned her to make me a bolt of cloth.  I asked for the brightest colors possible like a rainbow (for my daughter) and asked for permission to video her work.  She worked for about a day and a half.  I filmed this in the afternoon of the first day.  If you look closely at the end of the video you can almost see the pride in her eyes that I'm taking such interest in her craft.\r\n\r\nNotice the child with an umbilical hernia in the background.\r\n\r\n\r\nA buddy of mine from Canada did the music.
