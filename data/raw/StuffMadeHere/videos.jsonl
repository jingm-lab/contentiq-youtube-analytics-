Imagine throwing a ball and if it hits the backboard it somehow gets directed into the hoop. Thanks to physics it isn't quite possible to make ALL possible shots go in though you can make a hoop where the ball goes in a lot more often.

It turns out that I was right and as I've been cutting more I've noticed a real uptick in accumulated metal on the ground. To address this problem I built a filtering system designed to remove the bigger particles from the exhaust. Since I'm not concerned with smoke and really extremely fine vapor I was able to make a \"solid state\" filter that takes advantage of the inability of a heavy particle to follow a tight corner. It was inspired by cyclonic seperators on larger shop vacuum systems. From the testing that I've done it seems to work quite well and I'm pretty happy with the results.\n\nThese videos usually take a ton of work and a lot of money in tools and materials.

It turns out that I was right and as I've been cutting more I've noticed a real uptick in accumulated metal on the ground. To address this problem I built a filtering system designed to remove the bigger particles from the exhaust. Since I'm not concerned with smoke and really extremely fine vapor I was able to make a \"solid state\" filter that takes advantage of the inability of a heavy particle to follow a tight corner.
