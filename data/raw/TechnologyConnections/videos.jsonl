Link below    \nIf you’re among the 85%* of people who don’t know what an LED printer is, then prepare to have your mind mildly blown as I tell you about the common printer tech that may in fact by lurking in your home or office, but which you’ve been mistakenly referring to as a laser printer.  *gasp*\n\n* This percentage was gathered via Twitter poll.  If anything, I’d say the general population is even less likely to know what an LED printer is, as my followers on Twitter would, I should think, be a little more interested in technology than the average individual.  Hey, did you know you can follow me on Twitter?  Here’s a link!  https://twitter.com/TechConnectify\n\nVarious links to stuff:\nI used a couple of animations from a website called “printermalls.com”.

Link below\nAround the mid-2000’s, the LED traffic light began making its way onto the scene.

Not producing sufficient heat to melt snow on their lenses, some drivers became confused by ambiguous signals and caused fatal accidents.\nThis video tells the tale of why this newfound “problem” generated harsh criticism to the new technology, and explains why this reaction is entirely dumb and regressive.\n\nWatch me take apart one of these traffic light modules here:\nhttps://youtu.be/hRbnK4cDXPY\n\nYou can support this channel on Patreon!

Link below\nAround the mid-2000’s, the LED traffic light began making its way onto the scene.  Recent developments in LED technology meant that energy efficient replacements for the standard incandescent lamp were beginning to appear.  Municipalities rejoiced with the energy savings they provided, but in cold climates they weren’t met with quite as warm a welcome.  Not producing sufficient heat to melt snow on their lenses, some drivers became confused by ambiguous signals and caused fatal accidents.\nThis video tells the tale of why this newfound “problem” generated harsh criticism to the new technology, and explains why this reaction is entirely dumb and regressive.\n\nWatch me take apart one of these traffic light modules here:\nhttps://youtu.be/hRbnK4cDXPY\n\nYou can support this channel on Patreon!

Ace Hardward sells \"Janitorial Strength Ammonia\" which has no additives.  This works really well, but the stuff is nasty.  Real nasty.

This is that story.\n\nThis channel is made possible through supporters on Patreon.  These supporters have allowed me to go part time from my day job and keep these videos coming more frequently.

They're definitely worth checking out, and apparently you can visit the museum if you're in their area.  From this website, this story about the early color systems is great:\nhttp://www.earlytelevision.org/color_tv_cooper.html\nThis link also includes fantastic information on the CBS color wheel system:\nhttp://www.earlytelevision.org/cbs_color_system.html\n\nInformation on NTSC encoding was supplemented from this overview on color details:\nhttp://nemesis.lonestar.org/reference/internet/web/color/ntsc_primer.html\nBasics for many encoding techniques were gathered from everyone's favorite reliable source of knowledge.  Some good reads:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrature_amplitude_modulation\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTSC\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorburst\n\nThank you to all of my current Patrons!\n\nTommi Hares, Alex Smith, Dakota Williams, Eitan Tal, Quinton Wilson, Jeremy DeGuzman, Sean Spark, Lucas Hartbarger, Taylor Cuzela, twiglet, David Lastres, Granger Meador, Jeremy Kitchen, Jason Wellband, Shane Belaire, Paul Emmerich, Sam Hodge, Matthew Rossi, Paul Craigie, Paul Williams, Lukas Komischke, Dave Anderson, Felix Freiberger, Dane Peterson, Brent LaRowe, Aerospyke, Kieran Cox, Hunter Schwisow, wsh, Logan Kriete, Rafał Wiosna, Adam D.

Link below\nThe late 1970's and early 1980's were a frightening time to be a video enthusiast.  Two formats are duking it out and trying to assert their dominance, and although Sony was first* to market with their Betamax machine, they were caught off guard by JVC's competing VHS system which, rather than focus on pedantic details like cassette design and technical perfection, strived to make a cheap, versatile format that worked.\n\nThis is part one of the story of the VHS and Betamax format war.  Part two will be following shortly.\n\nPart Two:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v019trxfcmg\n\nWas the quality of Beta really better?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oJs8-I9WtA\n\nIf you like videos likes this, I humbly ask that you subscribe to Technology Connections.
